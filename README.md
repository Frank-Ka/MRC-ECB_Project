# RC-ECB-64-Project
RC-ECB-64-Retro-Computing-Project

This is a DIY Z80 Retro Computersystem based on the old style system bus ECB with some pin modifications.
The PCB size for modules is 100x100mm for low cost manufacturing, but also 160x100mm is possible.

The designs on this project site are generally open source. You can recreate them yourself or modify them if
you wish. The documentation, schematics, printed circuit board Gerber Ô¨Åles of the RC-ECB-64 modules will be placed next on this repository.

The backplanes ready to use on table or mounting in a 3HE rack frame for stable mechanic.
The Backplanes in 5 and 7 slot Version tested, a 12 slot backplane work is in progress

The main system circuitry and port mapping follows stephen cousin's open source sc700 project on "smallcomputercentral.com"
So the RC-ECB-64 Computer system is ready to run ROMWBW, SCM, CP/M, Basic and more.
 
There are four core modules
- CPU with MMU
- MEM with 512k ROM and 512k RAM
- SIO for terminal communication
- and the CF Card interface.

Some more modules, such as FDC, RTC, DIO, Sound interface and VGA Terminal Card are being tested at this time.
